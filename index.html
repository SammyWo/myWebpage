    <strong>Name: </strong>Sam Mennen<br>
    <strong>Student Number: </strong>s3876937<br>
    <strong>Student Email: </strong>s3876937@student.rmit.edu.au<br><br>
    <strong>Background: </strong> 
    Born in Australia with Polish, Irish and Dutch family background. I finished high 
    school in 2007 and began work as sound technician from 2009. Over the next 9 years I travelled 
    Australia working at events large and small specialising as a monitor operator. In 2015 I decided 
    to pursue a University Degree and commenced my Bachelor in International Studies. During my 
    studies I studied Japanese language, International history and politics. I was also had the 
    opportunity to study abroad in South Korea at Pukyong National University in Busan as part of 
    there international summer school program. In 2018 I finished my Bachelor degree and later 
    moved to Japan with my girlfriend (Now wife). Over the next 2 years I worked in Japan in the 
    Education and Tourism industries. After getting married in early 2020, my wife and I decided to 
    return to Australian and continue our lives together here.<br><br>
    <strong>Interesting Fact: </strong>  
    I am a huge fan of Tan Tan Men, a Chinese style noodle dish that is popular in Japan.
    I entered a Tan Tan Men eating competition. The soup was extremely viscous and thick, quite difficult to eat. 
    After the competition I became incredibly sick and what was normally a 10 minute walk home took over 
    2 hours of excruciating pain. I still love Tan Tan Men, however I will not be entering any eating 
    competitions anytime soon.

  <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
  <h4>What is your interest in IT? How did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
   Outline IT Experience (if any).</h4>
  <p>
    IT has played a significant role all my life as I grew up in the advent of every household owning a computer. Now we carry computing devices wherever we go.
    My interest in IT first started when I was very young, perhaps 3 or 4 years old when my father purchased an Amiga computer. At the time the technology seemed 
    so monumental and the playing games on the Amiga (despite the now incredibly rudimentary graphics) sparked a great deal of imagination and wonder. Later in 
    life I became involved in music production and recording I started to use a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) named Ardour. <br><br>
    Ardour is an open source application that permits the users to make modifications and adjustments to help improve the software. I learned that gitHub is the
    main tool for collaborators used to access and modify source code (Ardour/ardour, 2020). Through gitHub I was able to learn who these collaborators were and
    what programming languages they used such as python, C++, C and Javascript. While I had little understanding about many of the tools and techniques used in 
    developing software, seeing all the work and effort that goes into developing such software made me appreciate the skills necessary for such a project.<br><br>
    Witnessing the community actively work together to make something special truly inspired me and rekindled some of the fascination with IT that I had when I was 
    younger. Despite having limited previous IT experience and no experience developing software, I hope to one day be able to develop software and perhaps contribute
    to a project.

  <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
  <h4>Turbulent Mediator</h4>
   <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/2331bfe926b70">16 Personalities</a>
   <p></p>
   <img src="TurbulentMediator.jpg"style="width:870px;height:330;"> 
   
  <p>
    I scored the Turbulent Mediator personality type. Supposedly this means that I am a True Idealist and always try to see the good in people and make things better, 
    seeking constant improvement. A characteristic of this personality type is being guided by principle and taking an altruistic stance on issues, performing task to
    achieve what is right and not for rewards or fear of punishment.  While I think the result is overly broad in describing anyones personality type as situation and
    circumstance greatly effect one’s behaviour, I do feel the result does encapsulate some of my personality. In particular a focus on the larger picture and open-
    mindedness.<br><br>

    As part of a team, my personality as a mediator affords proficiency in communicating which is further encompassed in my altruistic nature. Largely positive 
    attributes however my preference for conflict avoidance and over arcing focus may cause me to overlook small but important details.<br><br>

    When forming teams, I am required take into account my attitude towards conflict. If there is a fracture in the group turbulent mediators tend not to pick sides 
    and will try to mend any problems. If the conflict can not be solved turbulent mediators can take it too personally. It is important to understand that there are 
    circumstances beyond my influence and that I can not mend everything.

  <h4>Learning Style</h4>
  <a href="http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/">Learning Style Test</a>
  <p></p>
  <img src="LearningStyleChart.png"style="width:870px;height:330;">
  <p>
    According to this test, my primary learning style is the Reflector Style. I prefer to stand back and observe and approach learning in a cautious manner. Like with the
    personality test, I tend to focus on the larger picture. This is somewhat agreeable as I am not the type to stand out and ask question but focus and observe in the 
    matter at hand.<br></br> 
    My secondary learning style is the pragmatist style, a more practical and hands on approach keen for experimentation and trying new ideas. A strength of this learning 
    style is an a preference for discussion and finding solutions in problem solving settings. Furthermore this learning method is often straight to the point avoiding 
    unnecessary information to achieve a result.<br></br> 
    In a team, these learning styles indicate that I am more of the type that focuses on the larger picture and the end result. While not taking an aggressive approach 
    to team challenges, a reflector style learner will be more observant and cautious when engaging with the team. The pragmatist indicates that I may be more likely to 
    perform and experiment with tasks and encourage discussion among other team members. <br></br> 
    When forming a team, it is important that I take into account my observant and cautious style reflector learning style. It may be difficult to compete with others in 
    the group who may be more aggressive with an activist learning style, and I may express difficulty putting my work forward.  Its important to strengthen my pragmatist 
    learning style which encourages discussion with the group and encourage new ideas.

   <h4>Personality Type</h4>
   <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=2.6,3.2,3.6,3.1,4.1#_V">Big 5 personality Test</a>
   <p></p>
   <img src="big5StyleTest.png"style="width:870px;height:330;">
   <p>
     After taking the Big 5 personality test I scored highest in Factor V for Intellect and Imagination. This reinforces the results of previous personality tests with 
     open-minded characteristics. My secondary factor, Factor III for Agreeableness paints me as a friendly and optimistic character. While some of these characteristics
     are synonymous with the previous two tests, scoring lower Factor IV Conscientiousness contradicts my more cautious nature expressed in the other tests.

     In a team, the results of the Big 5 personality test indicate that I am open to ideas and willing to explore different possibilities and try different things. My secondary
     trait indicates that I can be a friendly team member and am willing to agree with other team member suggestions. 

     When forming a team, it is important that I consider my like Factor I Extroversion trait and how it may effect Factor III. I may find myself agreeing with more aggressive 
     team members even if I am not particularly fond of their suggestions. It is important for me to develop some more assertive personality traits to help move projects further 
     in times of stagnation or when a more straight-forward direction is necessary.
