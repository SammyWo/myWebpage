  <h3>About Me</h3>
 
  <p>
  
    <strong>Name: </strong>Sam Mennen<br>
    <strong>Student Number: </strong>s3876937<br>
    <strong>Student Email: </strong>s3876937@student.rmit.edu.au<br><br>
    <strong>Background: </strong> 
     Born in Australia with Polish, Irish and Dutch family background. I finished high 
     school in 2007 and began work as sound technician from 2009. Over the next 9 years I travelled 
     Australia working at events large and small specialising as a monitor operator. In 2015 I decided 
     to pursue a University Degree and commenced my Bachelor in International Studies. During my 
     studies I studied Japanese language, International history and politics. I was also had the 
     opportunity to study abroad in South Korea at Pukyong National University in Busan as part of 
     there international summer school program. In 2018 I finished my Bachelor degree and later 
     moved to Japan with my girlfriend (Now wife). Over the next 2 years I worked in Japan in the 
     Education and Tourism industries. After getting married in early 2020, my wife and I decided to 
     return to Australian and continue our lives together here.<br><br>
    <strong>Interesting Fact: </strong>  
     I am a huge fan of Tan Tan Men, a Chinese style noodle dish that is popular in Japan.
     I entered a Tan Tan Men eating competition. The soup was extremely viscous and thick, quite difficult to eat. 
     After the competition I became incredibly sick and what was normally a 10 minute walk home took over 
     2 hours of excruciating pain. I still love Tan Tan Men, however I will not be entering any eating 
     competitions anytime soon.

  <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
  <h4>What is your interest in IT? How did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
   Outline IT Experience (if any).</h4>
  <p>
    IT has played a significant role all my life as I grew up in the advent of every household owning a computer. Now we carry computing devices wherever we go.
    My interest in IT first started when I was very young, perhaps 3 or 4 years old when my father purchased an Amiga computer. At the time the technology seemed 
    so monumental and the playing games on the Amiga (despite the now incredibly rudimentary graphics) sparked a great deal of imagination and wonder. Later in 
    life I became involved in music production and recording I started to use a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) named Ardour. <br><br>
    Ardour is an open source application that permits the users to make modifications and adjustments to help improve the software. I learned that gitHub is the
    main tool for collaborators used to access and modify source code (Ardour/ardour, 2020). Through gitHub I was able to learn who these collaborators were and
    what programming languages they used such as python, C++, C and Javascript. While I had little understanding about many of the tools and techniques used in 
    developing software, seeing all the work and effort that goes into developing such software made me appreciate the skills necessary for such a project.<br><br>
    Witnessing the community actively work together to make something special truly inspired me and rekindled some of the fascination with IT that I had when I was 
    younger. Despite having limited previous IT experience and no experience developing software, I hope to one day be able to develop software and perhaps contribute
    to a project.

    is required for the development of products and systems.
