    <p>
      <strong>Name: </strong>Sam Mennen<br>
      <strong>Student Number: </strong>s3876937<br>
      <strong>Student Email: </strong>s3876937@student.rmit.edu.au<br><br>
      <strong>Background: </strong> 
      Born in Australia with Polish, Irish and Dutch family background. I finished high school in 2007 and began work as sound technician from 2009. Over the next
      9 years I travelled around Australia working at events large and small specialising as a monitor operator. In 2015 I decided to pursue a University Degree 
      and commenced my bachelor&#39;s in international studies. During my studies I studied Japanese language, International history and politics. I was also had the 
      opportunity to study abroad in South Korea at Pukyong National University in Busan as part of their international summer school program. In 2018 I finished
      my bachelor&#39;s degree and later moved to Japan with my girlfriend (Now wife). Over the next 2 years I worked in Japan in the Education and Tourism industries.
      After getting married in early 2020, my wife and I decided to return to Australian and continue our lives together here.<br><br>
      <strong>Interesting Fact: </strong>  
      I am a huge fan of Tan Tan Men, a Chinese style noodle dish that is popular in Japan. I entered a Tan Tan Men eating competition. The soup was extremely viscous
      and thick, quite difficult to eat. After the competition I became incredibly sick and what was normally a 10-minute walk home took over 2 hours of excruciating pain.
      I still love Tan Tan Men; however, I won’t be entering any eating competitions anytime soon.

    <h3 id="interest">Interest in IT</h3>
    <h4>What is your interest in IT? How did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
     Outline IT Experience (if any).</h4>
    <p>
      IT has played a significant role all my life as I grew up in the advent of every household owning a computer. Now we carry computing devices wherever we go. 
      My interest in IT first started when I was very young, perhaps 3 or 4 years old when my father purchased an Amiga computer. At the time the technology seemed 
      so monumental and the playing games on the Amiga (despite the now incredibly rudimentary graphics) sparked a great deal of imagination and wonder. Later in 
      life I became involved in music production and recording I started to use a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) named Ardour. 
    </p>  
    <p> 
     Ardour is an open source application that permits the users to make modifications and adjustments to help improve the software. I learned that gitHub is the 
     main tool for collaborators used to access and modify source code (Ardour/ardour, 2020). Through gitHub I was able to learn who these collaborators were and 
     what programming languages they used such as python, C++, C and JavaScript. While I had little understanding about many of the tools and techniques used in 
     developing software, seeing all the work and effort that goes into developing such software made me appreciate the skills necessary for such a project.
    </p>  
    <p>
      Witnessing the community actively work together to make something special truly inspired me and rekindled some of the fascination with IT that I had when I
      was younger. Despite having limited previous IT experience and no experience developing software, I hope to one day be able to develop software and perhaps
      contribute to a project.

    <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
    <p>
      In regard to studying any technology, RMIT appears to be a perfect option given its history as a technical education facility. The more practical study method
      taught by relevant industry professionals offers a great deal. It is my hope that RMIT can afford me real-world, industry relevant skills. Furthermore, RMIT 
      is among Australia’s top five universities and any relevant qualification would be held in high esteem among future peers.
    </p>
    <h3>What do you expect to learn from your studies?</h3>
    <p>
    While it is expected do to learn some practical skills in my studies such as basic IT concepts and practical use of technology. More importantly I expect team 
    based and collaborative skills to be a main focus of study. Experience with gitHub, online meeting platforms and file sharing methods can potentially go far 
    being the scope of basic technical skills and lead to further professional development as my career progresses regardless of what specific field I choose to pursue.

      System Integration Officer as advertised on <a href="https://erecruit1.mercury.com.au/EyeAndEar/ViewPosition.aspx?id=w1tuIPiitkc=&jbc=seek">
      https://erecruit1.mercury.com.au/EyeAndEar/ViewPosition.aspx?id=w1tuIPiitkc=&jbc=seek </a>13th September 2020. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      The advertised position as a System Integration officer is responsible for developing and maintaining integration technologies, largely for those who are either
      vision impaired or suffer from hearing loss. The particular system in question relate to clinical systems in hospitals as well as business functions. This position
      is appealing to me as it requires knowledge of a wide breath of systems such as infrastructure/ network systems, communications and webservices. Furthermore, the
      position is intended to increase accessibility for those who suffer from some kind of disability or impairment. While the advertised position does not have an 
      advertised salary, the projects and developments related to position are potentially very rewarding and contribute to the wellbeing of the general community.
    </p>  
    <p>
      The position requires a variety of skills and knowledge. An understanding of business applications and web applications is paramount as that is the architecture 
      the System Integration Officer will be responsible maintaining. The advertised position specifically mentions middleware/ integration, HL7 messaging as well as web
      services and server infrastructure. The role also specifically mentions Java as a programming language that will be required and in regard to data bases it is a 
      reasonable assumption that proficiency in SQL or similar frameworks are required. As this is a wide variety of skills, it is assumed that the position requires an
      individual with postgraduate qualifications as well as professional experience with business applications, infrastructure and web development.
      Currently I do not have the required academic qualifications to attain this position. In order to apply successfully, I will need to achieve minimum a bachelor’s

    <h4>Turbulent Mediator</h4>
     <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/2331bfe926b70">16 Personalities</a>
     <p></p>
     <img src="TurbulentMediator.jpg"style="width:470px;height:170;" class="center"> 
   
    <p>
      I scored the Turbulent Mediator personality type. Supposedly this means that I am a True Idealist and always try to see the good in people and make things better, 
      seeking constant improvement. A characteristic of this personality type is being guided by principle and taking an altruistic stance on issues, performing task to 
      achieve what is right and not for rewards or fear of punishment.  While I think the result is overly broad in describing anyone’s personality type as situation and
      circumstance greatly effect one’s behavior, I do feel the result does encapsulate some of my personality. In particular a focus on the larger picture and open-mindedness.
    </p> 
    <p>
      As part of a team, my personality as a mediator affords proficiency in communicating which is further encompassed in my altruistic nature. Largely positive attributes
      however my preference for conflict avoidance and over arcing focus may cause me to overlook small but important details.
    </p>
    <p>
      When forming teams, I am required take into account my attitude towards conflict. If there is a fracture in the group turbulent mediators tend not to pick sides and 
      will try to mend any problems. If the conflict cannot be solved turbulent mediators can take it too personally. It is important to understand that there are circumstances
      beyond my influence and that I cannot mend everything.

    <h4>Learning Style</h4>
    <a href="http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/">Learning Style Test</a>
    <p></p>
    <img src="LearningStyleChart.png"style="width:470px;height:170;" class="center">
    <p>
      According to this test, my primary learning style is the Reflector Style. I prefer to stand back and observe and approach learning in a cautious manner. Like with the 
      personality test, I tend to focus on the larger picture. This is somewhat agreeable as I am not the type to stand out and ask question but focus and observe in the matter
      at hand. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      My secondary learning style is the pragmatist style, a more practical and hands on approach keen for experimentation and trying new ideas. A strength of this learning 
      style is a preference for discussion and finding solutions in problem solving settings. Furthermore, this learning method is often straight to the point avoiding 
      unnecessary information to achieve a result.
    </p>
    <p>  
      In a team, these learning styles indicate that I am more of the type that focuses on the larger picture and the end result. While not taking an aggressive approach to 
      team challenges, a reflector style learner will be more observant and cautious when engaging with the team. The pragmatist indicates that I may be more likely to perform
      and experiment with tasks and encourage discussion among other team members. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      When forming a team, it is important that I take into account my observant and cautious style reflector learning style. It may be difficult to compete with others in the
      group who may be more aggressive with an activist learning style, and I may express difficulty putting my work forward.  Its important to strengthen my pragmatist learning
      style which encourages discussion with the group and encourage new ideas.
    </p>
  
     <h4>Personality Type</h4>
     <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=2.6,3.2,3.6,3.1,4.1#_V">Big 5 personality Test</a>
     <p></p>
     <img src="big5StyleTest.png"style="width:470px;height:170;" class="center">
     <p>
       After taking the Big 5 personality test, I scored highest in Factor V for Intellect and Imagination. This reinforces the results of previous personality tests with open-minded
       characteristics. My secondary factor, Factor III for Agreeableness paints me as a friendly and optimistic character. While some of these characteristics are synonymous 
       with the previous two tests, scoring lower Factor IV Conscientiousness contradicts my more cautious nature expressed in the other tests.
     </p>
     <p>
       In a team, the results of the Big 5 personality test indicate that I am open to ideas and willing to explore different possibilities and try different things. My secondary 
       trait indicates that I can be a friendly team member and am willing to agree with other team member suggestions.  
     </p>
     <p>
       When forming a team, it is important that I consider my like Factor I Extroversion trait and how it may affect Factor III. I may find myself agreeing with more aggressive
       team members even if I am not particularly fond of their suggestions. It is important for me to develop some more assertive personality traits to help move projects further
       in times of stagnation or when a more straight-forward direction is necessary.

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) is the greatest contributor of premature hearing loss in young adults. Johnston&#39;s findings based on National Institute for Safety & Health
      (NIOSH) criteria indicate limiting how long you are exposed to excessive noise above 85dBA can significantly reduce the risk of earring loss (Johnston, 2020). The intended 
      project proposed is a browser-based noise exposure indicator using generic consumer devices such as smartphones or personal computers. Users will be able to open a webpage
      and using their devices microphone, measure the sound pressure level (SPL) of their environment. If the user is exposed to dangerous levels of SPL over a period of time the
      program will issue a warning that the user needs to have a rest and reduce noise exposure.
    </p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>  
    <p>
      Despite strict OH&S regulations introducing noise exposure measures to industrial worksites, other work environments such as offices, loud bars and restaurants still pose a
      potential risk. Safework Australia recommends that noise exceeding 50dBa for focused conversational work and 70dBA for routine work should be met with some noise exposure 
      procedures (Noise, 2020). By creating a browser-based noise exposure meter, small businesses and individuals will have a cost-effective way to measure the relative loudness
      of their environment.  This will result in more people being aware of their noise exposure and hopefully reduce rates of premature hearing loss.
    </p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The Product is intended to be highly accessible. For this purpose, the product will be available using any web browser and compatible with a variety of devices. The most 
      common being a smartphone or tablet. When the user accesses the webpage on their browser and allows access to their device’s microphone, the browser will collect measurements
      and data from the microphone and display results on the web page. The webpage will display the current SPL in decibels (dBA) and indicate how much excessive noise the user 
      has been exposed to. This can either be displayed as a percentage with 100% being the maximum permitted amount of exposure, or a timer that counts down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The product will utilise a timer to access how much noise the user has been exposed to. When noise exceeds a threshold, the timer counts down. Once the timer reaches zero,
      the user will be warned that they have been exposed to excessive noise. Based on the NIOSH recommend exposure limit (Johnston, 2020), the threshold will start at 85dBA with 
      8 hours of permitted exposure. If the SPL increases by 3dB, the timer will double in speed halving the permitted exposure time. For example; when the user initiates the program,
      the timer is set to 8 hours. The timer only starts to count down when SPL exceeds 85dBA. If SPL exceeds 88dBA the timer will double in speed until the SPL lowers below 88dBA 
      where it returns to normal speed. If the noise continues to drop below 85dBA the timer will pause.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>SPL (dBA)</th>
        <th>85</th>
        <th>88</th>
        <th>91</th>
        <th>94</th>
        <th>100</th>
      </tr>   
      <tr>
        <td>NIOSH Permitted noise exposure (Hours)</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0.25</td>
      </tr> 
    </table>
    <p>
      The product is not intended to record accurate measurements as that would require professional calibrated equipment. This is a tool to keep the user aware of how much noise
      they are exposed to and only approximate measurements are necessary.  The webpage will detail some instructions to the user on setting up their device to capture the best 
      results possible.  The above table will be displayed for reference. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      Similar tools do exist, such as Audio Tool&#39;s Dosimeter which is a paid add-on for their iPhone application (AudioTools - dB, Sound & Audio, 2020). However, there is no such
      browser-based tool that is easily accessible.  There are some browser-based sound level meters such as the Youlean&#39;s free loudness meter (Free Online Loudness and Sound Meter
      by Youlean, 2020). This does not however indicate to the user the amount of noise they are exposed to over a period of time and the average user may not be able to interpret 
      the data presented in an informed manner.  The proposed product is intended to be simple so that the results are easily understood.
    </p>
    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p>
      The product requires access to a microphone. Most consumer grade devices such as smartphones and tablets have the ability to capture an audio source. For more comprehensive setups,
      use of a measurement microphone and an audio interface can be used for more accurate results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspecting the code of Youlean&#39;s Free Loudness Meter, it is possible to create a sound meter on a webpage using html however the sound meter itself is most likely constructed using
      another programming language.  Wilson (2017) developed a simple volume meter to monitor a live audio input using java script and a similar volume meter can be constructed based on
      Wilson&#39;s work. Similar sound meters have also been developed using Python and other programming languages. Using GitHub, the project can be constructed and tested by developers allowing
      version control and frequent updates.
    </p>
    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    <p>
      To develop this product, skills in four different areas are required. First is a basic knowledge of audio and acoustics and how to interpret audio data and provide it to the user in an
      easily understandable manner. Secondly some aptitude in html is required to structure the webpage. Thirdly, in order to construct the sound level meter and timer, some understanding of 
      a programming language such as java script is required. Last, skills in front end design to create the user interface are required.
    </p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>
      If the project is successful, there will be an increase in awareness of excessive noise exposure and a reduction in noise induced hearing loss.  Because the final product is intended to
      be free and highly accessible, there is no barrier for the average user to utilise the product. If the initial product is successful, future versions of the software can have customisable 
      features to tailor to different standards and work environments. This will ensure the product is future proof and can adapt to changes in safety standards and practices as they develop.
